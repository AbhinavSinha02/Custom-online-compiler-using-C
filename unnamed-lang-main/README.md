# Unnamed-lang
A programming language compiler built using C. For learning purposes only!

The goal of this language was to compile FizzBuzz entirely, which meant writing to stdout, loops, mod operator, and if statements were required, which were all implemented.
This project was created to learn concepts of compiler design and to implement various data structures such as linked lists an d Hashmaps to create the compiler , the exmaples file contains the depiction of whta the code syntax looks like.
To see how the syntax looks, checks the examples folder.

The project is not planned to go any further than its current state.
